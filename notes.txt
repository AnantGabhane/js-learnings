[1] what is JS
- Become full stack

Where does JS code runs?
    - initially designed to run on browser
    - browser had JS engine
    - Chrome : V8 engine 

Node 
 - Ryan took JS engine in chrome and embedded it inside a C++ program called Node
 - Node is cpp program that includes V8 engine 
 - Because of this we can run JS code outside the browser
 - we can pass our JS code to node for execution 
 - Due to this we can build backend for our web and mobile app

browsers and node provide a runtime environment for our JS code

Difference between JS and ECMAScript :
- JS is a language & ECMAScript is specification

- 2015 they released ES6 

- chrome Inspect -> console 

[2] Js needs
- need node to install 3rd party libraries 

[3] How to install node 
    <script src="index.js"></script>
    tells html Where all the js changes are 
    To install node - refer - https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

[4] What is node?
    - node executes js code in terminal 
    - runtime env for js code ->> node 

[5] variables
    - varible to store data temp 
    - we store data some where in computer memory and give that location a name 
    - varible is a name given to a location in memory

[6] constant 
    - we don't want variable value to be changed
    - no need to redefine then use const and if we need reassign value then we use variable

[7] Dynamic Typing 
    - Static language - when we declare a var then type of var is set and cannot be changed

    - Dynamic language - type of var can be changed at runtime 

    typeof (varname)

    primitive / value types
        string 
        number
        boolean
        undefined
        null

    - undefined is also a var type in js

[8] Objects 
    - Refernce type 
        Object 
        Array 
        Function

    - Object has properties like a person has ie name, age, gender.
    - object has key and value pairs
        keys - properties of the object
        values - values of the properties

"JS is a Dynamic language so type of variables can be chnaged at runtime"

[9] Array
    - Array is a collection of values ie objects 
    - we use arrays to store list of objects
    - length of arary is also Dynamic it can also change 
    - we store multiple types of element in array
    - objects and size of array is Dynamic
    .length properties of the array shows the no of elements in the array.
    - DS we use to represent list of items 

[10] Functions
    - fundamental building block in js
    - function performs a set of asks 
    - function can have inputs and inputs can change how the function behaves
    - function input is called as parameter
    - parameter is called variable that is only meaningful inside a function
    - we pass argument while calling a function and we pass parameter while defining a function
    - function can have multiple parameters
    - if we don't pass to variable in js it is by default undefined
